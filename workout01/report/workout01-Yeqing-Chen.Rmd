  Depend on the shooting effective data. We can find that all five Golden State warriors are outstanding two-point shooters.  Since either the number of shoots or the effective shooting rate, these Golden State Warriors all have outstanding performance. They have at least 50% effective shooting percentage, and over hundreds shoots. Among them, Curry, Thompson and Durant did particularly well. They are fairly consistent and shoot many times.
  
  However, beyond Curry, Thompson and Durant, the Warriors simply didn't have many three-point shooters. The only other player who shoots above the league average of 35.8% is Andre Iguodala, who is still fairly inconsistent and doesn't shoot very many threes anyways. Thus, the Golden State Warriors invested in shooting even they already boast three of the greatest shooters of all time. NBA is an intensely competitive place. No one can promise he can stand on the first position forever. The Golden State Warriors still have many spaces to improve. Right now, their purpose is to train more great shooters. In the total shoots data, beyond Curry, Thompson and Durant, Andre Iguodala and Graymond Green doesn't shoot very many times. Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala's shot times are fall behind other players. They have a lot of space to improve.
 	
  In general, the Golden State Warriors is one of the best team in NBA league. The five player, Kevin Durant, Andre Iguodala, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, and Draymond Green, all have outstanding performance in season 2016.
