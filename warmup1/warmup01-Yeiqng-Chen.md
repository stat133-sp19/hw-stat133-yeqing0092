essential raised waffles

### Ingredients

-   1/2 cup warm water (about 105 to 110 degrees, so not too hot)
-   1 packet (1/4 ounce, 7 grams or 2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast
-   2 cups milk, warmed (again, not too hot
-   1 stick (4 ounces or 115 grams) unsalted butter, melted and cooled until lukewarm
-   1 teaspoon table salt
-   1 teaspoon granulated sugar
-   2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour
-   2 large eggs
-   1/4 teaspoon baking soda
-   Oil or melted butter for waffle iron Powdered sugar, syrup or berries for serving

### Kitchen Tools

-   waffle iron

### The steps of the recipe

> The night before: Pour warm water in the bottom of a large (larger than you think you'll need, because the batter will rise a lot) bowl. Sprinkle yeast on top and let it dissolve and foam ever-so-slightly for 15 minutes. Stir in milk, butter, salt, sugar and flour - I do a little bit of wet ingredients then a little bit of dry, back and forth, to avoid forming lumps. If lumps form, you can mostly whisk them out.

> Cover bowl with plastic wrap and set out on counter (see Note up top for debate on this) overnight.

> The next morning, whisk in eggs and baking soda until smooth. Heat waffle iron\*\* (a thinner one is better than a Belgian-style one, as these will not rise enough to fill a tall one out) and coat lightly with butter or oil. Ladle in 1/2 to 3/4-cup batter per waffle batch. The batter will be very thin and will spread a lot in the pan, so err on the side of underfilled until you figure out the right amount. Repeat with remaining batter.

> Waffles can be kept crisp in a warm oven until needed. If you only want to make a few at a time, the batter keeps well in the fridge for several days, says Cunningham.

Euclidean Distance
==================

### Definition <small>\[edit\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\\overline{\\mathbf{pq}})$.

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (p1, p2,..., pn) and **q** = (q1, q2,..., qn) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

where the last expression involves the dot product.

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.

The relationship between points **p** and **q** may involve a direction (for example, from **p** to **q**), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by

In a two- or three-dimensional space (n = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from **p** to **q**. In any space it can be regarded as the position of **q** relative to **p**. It may also be called a displacement vector if **p** and **q** represent two positions of some moving point.

The Euclidean distance between **p** and **q** is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:

which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:
